# calculator-for-android-project
I made a calculator application in it but I dont know what happened for HAXM. I installed it again and again it still showed nothing. When I downloaded in the
website for IntelHAXM 7.8.0. It said out-of-date. I really dont know what can I do:(. 
But I have a screen to show the application.
